This is my attempt to write code and help others

So, I am somewhat new at writting code. Yet, I have a desire to open up a tech-center that teachs 
computer programming and applications. also, a faucility that would cater to peoples desires of 
contributing to sociecty following their own passion. such as bossy people can learn to manage people and orgainizations
creative people could dance, sing, paint; scientific people could research and impliment; gardeners can grow and cultivate.
Or, how about intergrate the growth of hemp for the burnable oil, the ability to use the fibers as manufacturing material, 
cooking and lastly bug replent.
These are just a few ways to contribute to society I am currently exploring.
